	//////////	Tree traversal 		/////////

1. In-order Traversal
2. Pre-order Traversal
3. Post-order Traversal


1. INORDER TRAVERSAL: - The left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right sub-tree. we should remember that every node may represent a subtree itself.
#ALGORITHM:
UNTIL ALL NODE ARE TRAVERSED:-
s1:- Recursively traverse left subtree.
s2:- Visit root node.
s3:- Recursively traverse right subtree.

2. PRE-ORDER TRAVERSAL: - The root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree.
#ALGORITHM:
UNTIL ALL NODE ARE TRAVERSED:-
s1:- visit root node.
s2:- Recursively traverse left subtree.
s3:- Recursively traverse right subtree.

3. POST-ORDER TRAVERSAL: - The root node is visited last, first we traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node.
#ALGORITHM:
UNTIL ALL NODE ARE TRAVERSED:- 
s1:- Recursively traverse left subtree.
s2:- Recursively traverse right subtree.
s3:- visit root node.
